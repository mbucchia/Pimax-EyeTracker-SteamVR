# A demo of Eye Tracking Driver and Driver Shimming with SteamVR.

This program shows how to shim (extend) and existing, pre-compiled, SteamVR driver in order to add support for Eye Tracking.

# Developer Walkthrough

## Building and running

1) Make sure to check out all the submodules:

```
git submodule update --init
```

2) Open the VS solution and build the configuration of your choice. The output is placed under `bin/distribution` and matches the file layout expected by SteamVR.

3) **Make sure SteamVR is completely closed.** Then, from the `bin/distribution` folder, run `Register-Driver.bat` to register your driver with SteamVR.

## SteamVR API for Eye Tracking

Starting with SteamVR 2.8.3, the [`XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction`](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenXR/specs/1.0/man/html/XR_EXT_eye_gaze_interaction.html) OpenXR extension is advertised by the SteamVR OpenXR runtime. However, Valve yet has to publish an updated [OpenVR Driver SDK](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/tree/master/headers) with the necessary API for any 3rd party driver to send eye trackinh data to the extension.

In this project, we show how to use the undocumented API.

First, the driver must set property 6009 to indicate that it will send eye tracking data.

```cpp
    vr::VRProperties()->SetBoolProperty(container, (vr::ETrackedDeviceProperty)6009, true);
```

This effectively sets the value for the `XrSystemEyeGazeInteractionPropertiesEXT.supportsEyeGazeInteraction` property that applications can query:

The HMD class driver will need to use the undocumented internal interface `IVRDriverInput_XXX`, declared as follows:

```cpp
namespace vr {
    struct VREyeTrackingData_t {
        uint16_t flag1;
        uint8_t flag2;
        DirectX::XMVECTOR vector;
    };

    struct IVRDriverInputInternal_XXX {
        virtual void dummy01() = 0;
        virtual void dummy02() = 0;
        virtual vr::EVRInputError CreateEyeTrackingComponent(vr::PropertyContainerHandle_t ulContainer,
                                                             const char* pchName,
                                                             vr::VRInputComponentHandle_t* pHandle) = 0;
        virtual vr::EVRInputError UpdateEyeTrackingComponent(vr::VRInputComponentHandle_t ulComponent,
                                                             VREyeTrackingData_t* data) = 0;
    };
} // namespace vr
```

We retrieve a pointer to this interface:

```cpp
    vr::EVRInitError eError;
    vr::IVRDriverInputInternal_XXX* IVRDriverInputInternal_XXX =
        (vr::IVRDriverInputInternal_XXX*)vr::VRDriverContext()->GetGenericInterface("IVRDriverInputInternal_XXX", &eError);
```

We now create a special component to submit the eye tracking data and store the resulting handle:

```cpp
    IVRDriverInputInternal_XXX->CreateEyeTrackingComponent(container, "/eyetracking", &m_eyeTrackingComponent);
```

Finally, we can push eye tracking data to SteamVR when appropriate.

```
    VREyeTrackingData_t data{};
    if (isEyeTrackingDataAvailable) {
        // Not entirely sure what each bit means, but overall this means there is data to pass.
        data.flag1 = 0x101;
        data.flag2 = 0x1;
        data.vector = DirectX::XMVector3Normalize(DirectX::XMVectorSet(x, y, z, 1));
    } else {
        data.flag1 = 0;
        data.flag2 = 0;
        data.vector = DirectX::XMVectorSet(0, 0, -1, 1);
    }
    IVRDriverInputInternal_XXX->UpdateEyeTrackingComponent(m_eyeTrackingComponent, &data);
```

The gaze vector is a unit vector that originates from the center of the head and points forward (z=-1).

## Driver Shimming with SteamVR

The driver shimming technique allows you to extend or modify the behavior or a driver without recompiling or altering the driver. If you are a driver developer and develop you own driver, you do not need this. This technique is helpful for driver "modders". This technique has been demonstrated in complex drivers, such as the [Virtual Desktop](https://www.vrdesktop.net/) driver for hand and full body tracking.

In order to shim an existing driver, we create our own driver, with its own `HmdDriverFactory()` entry point returning an `IServerTrackedDeviceProvider` class instance. This driver will register a hook that intercepts creation of the driver we are shimming.

Our shim driver must be loaded early, which can be accomplished by providing a `defaults.vrsettings` file that sets the loading priority to a high value:

```json
{
  "driver_aapvr_shim": {
    "loadPriority": 1000
  }
}
```

Next, in our driver's activation function, `IServerTrackedDeviceProvider::Init()`, we can optionally determine whether we should attempt shimming (for example, we can detect whether the devices we care about are connected). This step ensures that we don't unnecessarily load our driver:

```cpp
    vr::EVRInitError Init(vr::IVRDriverContext* pDriverContext) override {
        VR_INIT_SERVER_DRIVER_CONTEXT(pDriverContext);

        // Detect whether we should attempt to shim the target driver.
        if (!m_isLoaded) {
            bool loadDriver = false;
            try {
                // FIXME: Do our checks here.
                loadDriver = true;
            } catch (...) {
            }

            if (loadDriver) {
                DriverLog("Installing IVRServerDriverHost::TrackedDeviceAdded hook");
                InstallShimDriverHook(/* Pass useful parameters here */);
                m_isLoaded = true;
            }
        }

        return m_isLoaded ? vr::VRInitError_None : vr::VRInitError_Init_HmdNotFound;
    }
```

The `InstallShimDriverHook()` implementation shows how to install a hook for the `IVRServerDriverHost::TrackedDeviceAdded()` method. This method is the entry point for drivers to register an HMD, controller or tracker device. This is where we will inject ourselves. The current implementation hooks the `IVRServerDriverHost_006` flavor of the interface, which may need to be changed depending on the flavor that the shimmed driver uses.

When our shimmed driver registers an HMD for example, our hook will be invoked, and we can wrap the `ITrackedDeviceServerDriver` class instance from the shimmed driver with the implementaion of our shim driver:

```cpp
    DEFINE_DETOUR_FUNCTION(bool,
                           IVRServerDriverHost_TrackedDeviceAdded,
                           vr::IVRServerDriverHost* driverHost,
                           const char* pchDeviceSerialNumber,
                           vr::ETrackedDeviceClass eDeviceClass,
                           vr::ITrackedDeviceServerDriver* pDriver) {
        vr::ITrackedDeviceServerDriver* shimmedDriver = pDriver;

        // Only shim the desired device class and if they are registered by the target driver.
        if (IsTargetDriver(_ReturnAddress())) {
            TraceLoggingWriteTagged(local, "IVRServerDriverHost_TrackedDeviceAdded", TLArg(true, "IsTargetDriver"));
            if (eDeviceClass == vr::TrackedDeviceClass_HMD) {
                DriverLog("Shimming new TrackedDeviceClass_HMD with HmdShimDriver");
                shimmedDriver = CreateHmdShimDriver(pDriver /* Forward other useful parameters here */);
            }
        }

        const auto status = original_IVRServerDriverHost_TrackedDeviceAdded(
            driverHost, pchDeviceSerialNumber, eDeviceClass, shimmedDriver);

        return status;
    }
```

In order to only shim the devices from the desired driver, we perform a check `IsTargetDriver()` that attempts to identify the calling driver. In our case here, we only shim HMD classes registered by the `driver_aapvr.dll` driver (Pimax).

And this is it! You can now implement your own `ITrackedDeviceServerDriver` class that wraps any other driver, and insert pre-invocation and/or post-invocation code for any method.

### Useful tips for troubleshooting

Your shim driver should be registered via `vrpathreg.exe adddriver` like any other SteamVR driver. This effectively updates `%LocalAppData%\openvr\openvrpaths.vrpaths` with the path to your shim driver:

![Sample content of the openvrpaths.vrpath file](images/openvrpaths.png)

This will make your shim driver show up in the _Settings -> Startup/Shutdown -> Manage Add-ons_ menu:

Logs can be viewed by opening the SteamVR Developer Console:

Finally, one of the most effective method for debugging is to use Visual Studio (or your favorite tool) and run `vrserver.exe --keepalive`, then start SteamVR normally. This will let you step through the shim driver initialization, and break upon errors.
